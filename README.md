# Binary Time and Date
A pebble watchface that displays the time and date in binary format.

Because I wanted to, that's why.

UPDATE: I just wanted to say that I loved my Pebble, not only for it's simple, yet robust design, or it's equally simple yet robust interface, it was one of the easiest platforms that I have ever been able to program in. I was able to make this incredible (though grossly inconvenient) watchface within a day or two of reading on the API. They even had their own _web IDE which wirelessly programmed_ my watchface to my Pebble through my phone, not to mention all the intuitive web interface for the web written in javascript. This was a company that cared about developers.
I'm gonna miss Pebble...

Apple watch is still good though...
